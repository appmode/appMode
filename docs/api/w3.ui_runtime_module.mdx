.ui
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ui runtime module provides for the creation and management of view & 
widget user interface components.


Global Namespace
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The global ui namespace is set to the value of the `w3.UI_NAMESPACE` constant.

By default the ui namespace is available as:

    window.ui
    ui
    
The ui namespace forms a tree of all widgets and views, for example:

    ui.viewName
    ui.viewName.widgetName
    ui.viewName.widgetName.childWidgetName
    
    
Attributes

obj     .views
:   All views that are currently loaded.
    An associative array object with the view names as keys.
            
obj     .widgets
:   All widgets that currently exist within the loaded views.
    An associative array object with the widget ids as keys.


Methods
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

wgt     .createView     ($strName, $objView)

    The created view widget or false if the widget type is not found.

wgt     .createWidget   ($strType, $objWidget, $bolChildren)
:   Create a JavaScript widget object.
    The DOM portion of the widget should already be loaded before this method is 
    called.

    wgt     return
    The requested widget or undefined if the widget does not exist.

elm     .html2Element   ($strHtml)
:   Creates a DOM element from a HTML string.
    
    Note that the HTML string must contain only a single tag at the base level. 
    Only the DOM element from the first tag will be returned, any siblings will 
    be ignored. The tag may contain child tags.
    
    str     $strHtml
    A string of HTML
                    
    elm     return
    A DOM element created from the HTML string      
    
bool    .isView         ($wgtTagret)
:   Check if something is a view like object.
    
    wgt     $wgtTagret
    A view, or maybe not.

bool    .isWidget       ($wgtTagret)
:   Check if something is a widget like object.
    
    wgt     $wgtTagret
    A widget, or maybe not.

arr     .id2array       ($strId)
:   Convert a widget id into an array representation of its path.
    
    This method will return an array something like:
    `['viewName','widgetName']`
    or
    `['viewName', 'parentWidgetName', 'widgetName']`
    
    str     $strId
    The id of the widget.
                    
    arr     return
    The widget path.
     
str     .id2Js          ($strId)
:   Convert a widget id into a string representation of its JavaScript
    address.
    
    This method will return something like:
    `"ui.viewName.widgetName"`
    or
    `"ui.viewName.parentWidgetName.widgetName"`

    str     $strId
    The id of the widget.
                    
    str     return
    The JavaScript address of the widget.

void    .loadView           ($strView [,$strWait])
:   Load a view.

    str     $strView
    Name of the view to load.
                    
    str     $strWait
    Optional. If `$strWait` matches the name of another view which is currently 
    loading, the view (`$strView`) will not render until after the specified 
    view has finished loading.
    
    By default the value of `$strWait` is set to the name of the previous view
    loaded via the `.loadView()` method. This ensures that views are loaded in 
    the order they are requested. To bypass the default behaviour and load a 
    view without waiting for the previous view to finish loading, set `$strWait` 
    to `true`.

void    .register       ($strType, $objConstructor, $strExtends)
:   Register a widget class.
    
    str     $strType
    The name of the widget type to register.
                    
    obj     $objConstructor
    The constructor class for the widget type.
        
    str     $strExtends
    Name of the widget class to extend from.
