About Widgets
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Widgets in appMode are the core building blocks of the user interface.

Each widget has a JavaScript widget object which can be accessed from within the 
tree of the ui namespace. All JavaScript widget objects extend either the base
widget type or another widget type (which in turn will extend the base widget
type).

### Attributes
Attributes of a widget are directly accessible via dot notation or square 
bracket notation. For example:

	$wgtWidget.attributeName
	$wgtWidget['attributeName']

Attributes names starting with an underscore are reserved for private 
attributes.

Attributes should be kept to a minimum to keep the widget namespace clear.

### Properties

Properties of a widget are stored internally and may only be accessed via the 
`.property()` method.

### Styles

Styles of a widget are stored internally and may only be accessed via the 
`.style()` method.
    
### Namespace

Each widget is a namespace for its direct child widgets. Child widgets are 
accessible via dot notation or square bracket notation. 
For example:

	$wgtWidget.childWidgetName
	$wgtWidget['childWidgetName']
